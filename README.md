- Suicide unfortunately is becoming an all too common phenomena, nationally and internationally. It is, unfortunately on the increase within the Defence Forces. It is hope that an examination of the Suicide data frame would give some relevant information that would outline what motivates such a drastic and final action. Is it a generational connection or is it more related to economics? Or is it both. 

-I intend to first look at the data and ensure that it is cleaned. I then would plot some trends.

-Finally, I will focus on Ireland and focus on it as a case study.
